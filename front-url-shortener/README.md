# URL Shortener

## Description

- This project uses [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) for the front
- There are four views: 
    - the Sign In page (which is also the hompage)
    - the Sign Up
    - My URLs
    - Shorten an URL pages
- The app also uses an API made with node, Express and MySQL
- It is possible to launch the app with or without [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## With Docker

- Launch and build: `docker-compose up --build` (the app is automtically started during this step)
- Open the app at url `localhost:3000`
- Down and delete running containers, volumes and networks: `docker-compose down`

## Without Docker

- Run `npm start` to run the app in the development mode. 
- Go to the url: `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Views

- Sign In (which is also the homepage): go to `localhost:3000`

- Sign Up: go to `localhost:3000/inscription`

- My URLs: go to `localhost:3000/mes-urls`
    - You have to be logged in to see this page
    - This is where the logged in user is able to see all his links shortened

- Shorten an URL: `localhost:3000/raccourcir-une-url`
    - You have to be logged in to see this page
    - This is where the logged in user is able to send a link to shorten
    
## Additional documentation for React

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
